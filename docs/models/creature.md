# Creature Model - Genealogical Simulation

**Document Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** November 8, 2025  
**Status:** Draft - In Progress

---

## 1. Overview

A **Creature** represents an individual organism in the simulation with a diploid genome, expressed traits (phenotypes), and lineage information. Creatures are the fundamental unit of the simulation - they reproduce, inherit genetic material, and persist across multiple generations (mutations in Phase 2).

---

## 2. Core Attributes

| Attribute | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `creature_id` | Integer | Unique identifier for the creature (auto-increment primary key) |
| `simulation_id` | Integer | Foreign key to simulation this creature belongs to |
| `birth_generation` | Integer | Generation when creature was born (fixed, never changes) |
| `sex` | Enum | Biological sex: 'male', 'female', or NULL (if sex not modeled) |
| `parent1_id` | Integer | Foreign key to first parent (NULL for founders) |
| `parent2_id` | Integer | Foreign key to second parent (NULL for founders) |
| `litters_remaining` | Integer | Number of litters remaining for this creature (starts at max value from simulation config, decrements per litter) |
| `is_alive` | Boolean | Whether creature is alive in current generation (for mortality modeling) |

**Design Notes:**
- Creatures persist across generations (they don't die automatically each generation)
- `birth_generation`: Fixed timestamp of when creature was born (stored in memory during simulation, persisted to database when creature is no longer relevant)
- Age calculation: `age = current_generation - birth_generation` where `current_generation` is in-memory simulation state
- Creatures have diploid genomes (two alleles per gene)
- Genome stored as array: `genome[trait_id] = genotype_string` (e.g., "BB", "Bb", "bb")
- Phenotypes derived from genotypes via trait configuration
- Lineage tracked via parent references (enables forward/backward traversal)
- Breeding eligibility: Age limit and litters_remaining limit defined at simulation level

**Key Distinction: `birth_generation` vs `current_generation`**
- **`birth_generation`**: The generation number when the creature was born. This is **stored in memory** during simulation and is fixed, never changes. When creatures are persisted to the database (after they can no longer reproduce), `birth_generation` is written to the database. Used to calculate age and determine breeding eligibility.
- **`current_generation`**: The current generation number in the simulation (increments each breeding cycle). This is **stored in memory as a simulation state variable** (not in database). Used to calculate creature age: `age = current_generation - birth_generation`.
- Creatures persist across multiple simulation generations in memory, so a creature born in generation 5 will still exist in memory in generation 10 (age = 5) until it can no longer reproduce.
- `birth_generation` is persisted to the database when creatures are written; `current_generation` is always a runtime simulation state.

## 3. Genome Representation

### 3.1 Diploid Structure

Each creature has a diploid genome - two copies of each chromosome/gene. For each trait, the creature has a genotype (allele combination).

**Genome Storage:**
- In-memory: NumPy array or Python dict: `genome[trait_id] = genotype_string`
- In database: Separate table with one row per trait per creature (normalized) - written when creature is persisted

**Example Genome:**
```python
creature.genome = {
    0: "BB",      # Trait 0 (Eye Color): homozygous dominant
    1: "RW",      # Trait 1 (Flower Color): heterozygous (incomplete dominance)
    2: "AB",      # Trait 2 (Blood Type): codominant
    3: "Nc",      # Trait 3 (Color Blindness): sex-linked, female carrier
    4: "H1H1_H2H2_H3h3"  # Trait 4 (Height): polygenic
}
```

### 3.2 Genotype Format

Genotypes are stored as strings matching the format defined in trait configuration:
- **Simple Mendelian:** "BB", "Bb", "bb" (two alleles)
- **Incomplete Dominance:** "RR", "RW", "WW" (two alleles)
- **Codominance:** "AA", "AO", "BB", "BO", "AB", "OO" (two alleles)
- **Sex-Linked:** "NN", "Nc", "cc" (females) or "N", "c" (males - single allele)
- **Polygenic:** "L1L1_L2L2_L3L3" (multiple genes, underscore-separated)

---

## 4. Lineage & Pedigree

### 4.1 Parent-Child Relationships

Each creature (except founders) has exactly two parents:
- `parent1_id`: Reference to first parent
- `parent2_id`: Reference to second parent
- Both parents must exist in the working pool (memory) and be alive at time of reproduction

**Founders (Birth Generation 0):**
- `parent1_id = NULL`
- `parent2_id = NULL`
- Created at simulation initialization with genotypes sampled from initial frequencies
- `birth_generation = 0`

### 4.2 Inbreeding Coefficient

Can be calculated from pedigree:
- Count shared ancestors between parent1 and parent2
- Calculate probability of identical-by-descent alleles
- Used by inbreeding avoidance breeders

---

## 5. Reproduction & Inheritance

### 5.1 Gamete Formation

When a creature reproduces, it produces gametes (sperm/egg) containing one allele per gene.

**Process:**
1. For each trait, randomly select one allele from the diploid pair
2. Use seeded pRNG: `rng.choice([allele1, allele2])`
3. Combine gametes from two parents to form offspring genotype

**Example - Simple Mendelian:**
```python
# Parent 1: "Bb" → gamete: randomly "B" or "b"
# Parent 2: "BB" → gamete: always "B"
# Offspring: "BB" or "Bb" (50/50 chance)
```

### 5.2 Independent Assortment

Genes on different chromosomes assort independently (Mendel's Law of Independent Assortment).

**Implementation:**
- Each trait's gamete selection is independent
- No linkage modeled in Phase 1 (future: linkage groups)

### 5.3 Sex-Linked Inheritance

For sex-linked traits, inheritance depends on parent sex:
- **X-linked (most common):**
  - Female parent: Contributes one X chromosome allele (random selection)
  - Male parent: Contributes X chromosome allele (only has one)
  - Offspring sex determines genotype format (male = single allele, female = two alleles)

**Example:**
```python
# Color blindness (X-linked recessive)
# Female parent: "Nc" → gamete: "N" or "c" (50/50)
# Male parent: "N" → gamete: "N"
# Offspring:
#   - If female: "NN" or "Nc" (50/50)
#   - If male: "N" (always, since father contributes X)
```

---

## 6. Breeding Eligibility & Limits

### 6.1 Age-Based Limits

Creatures can be excluded from breeding based on their age (number of generations since birth).

**Age Calculation:**
```python
age = current_simulation_generation - creature.birth_generation
```

**Age Limit:**
- Defined at simulation level (creature archetype configuration)
- Applies to **both males and females**
- If `age > max_age`, creature is not eligible for breeding
- Separate age limits can be configured for males and females

### 6.2 Litters Remaining Limits

Creatures can be excluded from breeding based on how many litters they have remaining.

**Litter Tracking:**
- `litters_remaining`: Integer counter, starts at the maximum value defined in simulation configuration
- Decrements by 1 each time creature produces a litter
- Only applies to **females** (males don't produce litters)
- Updated when female reproduces

**Litter Limit:**
- Defined at simulation level (creature archetype configuration)
- Only applies to **females**
- If `litters_remaining <= 0`, female is not eligible for breeding
- Males have no litter limit (unless specified in simulation config)

**Design Note:** These limits are part of the creature archetype defined in the simulation configuration, allowing different species/life histories to be modeled.

## 7. Database Schema (SQLite)

### 7.1 Creatures Table

```sql
-- Creatures Table
-- Stores basic creature information and lineage
CREATE TABLE creatures (
    creature_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    simulation_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
    birth_generation INTEGER NOT NULL CHECK(birth_generation >= 0),
    sex TEXT CHECK(sex IN ('male', 'female')) NULL,
    parent1_id INTEGER NULL,
    parent2_id INTEGER NULL,
    litters_remaining INTEGER NOT NULL CHECK(litters_remaining >= 0),
    is_alive BOOLEAN DEFAULT 1,
    FOREIGN KEY (simulation_id) REFERENCES simulations(simulation_id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    FOREIGN KEY (parent1_id) REFERENCES creatures(creature_id) ON DELETE SET NULL,
    FOREIGN KEY (parent2_id) REFERENCES creatures(creature_id) ON DELETE SET NULL,
    CHECK(parent1_id IS NULL = (birth_generation = 0)),  -- Founders have no parents
    CHECK(parent2_id IS NULL = (birth_generation = 0))
);

-- Indexes for efficient querying
CREATE INDEX idx_creatures_birth_generation ON creatures(simulation_id, birth_generation);
CREATE INDEX idx_creatures_parents ON creatures(parent1_id, parent2_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_creatures_breeding_eligibility ON creatures(simulation_id, sex, birth_generation, litters_remaining, is_alive);
```

### 7.2 Genotypes Table (Creature Genotypes)

```sql
-- Creature Genotypes Table
-- Stores genotype for each trait for each creature (normalized: one row per trait per creature)
CREATE TABLE creature_genotypes (
    creature_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
    trait_id INTEGER NOT NULL CHECK(trait_id >= 0),
    genotype TEXT NOT NULL,
    FOREIGN KEY (creature_id) REFERENCES creatures(creature_id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    FOREIGN KEY (trait_id) REFERENCES traits(trait_id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    PRIMARY KEY (creature_id, trait_id)
);

CREATE INDEX idx_creature_genotypes_trait ON creature_genotypes(trait_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_creature_genotypes_genotype ON creature_genotypes(genotype);
CREATE INDEX idx_creature_genotypes_creature ON creature_genotypes(creature_id);
```

**Design Notes:**
- Normalized approach: one row per trait per creature
- Better query performance (indexed trait_id and genotype)
- Easier to query "all creatures with genotype X for trait Y"
- Supports efficient aggregation queries
- More rows than denormalized approach, but SQLite handles this well

### 7.3 Example Data

```sql
-- Example: Persisting creatures to database after they can no longer reproduce
-- Founder creature (birth_generation 0) - persisted after becoming ineligible
INSERT INTO creatures (simulation_id, birth_generation, sex, parent1_id, parent2_id, litters_remaining)
VALUES (1, 0, 'male', NULL, NULL, 0);

INSERT INTO creature_genotypes (creature_id, trait_id, genotype) VALUES
(1, 0, 'BB'),  -- Eye Color: Brown
(1, 1, 'RR'),  -- Flower Color: Red
(1, 2, 'AA');  -- Blood Type: A

-- Offspring creature (birth_generation 1) - persisted after litters_remaining reached 0
INSERT INTO creatures (simulation_id, birth_generation, sex, parent1_id, parent2_id, litters_remaining)
VALUES (1, 1, 'female', 1, 2, 0);  -- litters_remaining = 0 when persisted

INSERT INTO creature_genotypes (creature_id, trait_id, genotype) VALUES
(2, 0, 'Bb'),  -- Eye Color: Brown (heterozygous)
(2, 1, 'RW'),  -- Flower Color: Pink (incomplete dominance)
(2, 2, 'AO');  -- Blood Type: A (heterozygous)

-- Note: During simulation, litters_remaining is decremented in memory.
-- The database reflects the final state when the creature is persisted.
```

## 8. Performance Considerations

### 8.1 Batch Operations

When persisting creatures to the database (after they can no longer reproduce):
- Use batch INSERT statements for efficient writes
- Insert creatures first, then genotypes in separate batch
- Use transactions for atomicity

```python
# Example batch insert when persisting creatures that are no longer relevant
creatures_data = [(sim_id, birth_gen, sex, p1, p2, litters_remaining) for ...]  # Creatures being removed from working pool
cursor.executemany(
    "INSERT INTO creatures (simulation_id, birth_generation, sex, parent1_id, parent2_id, litters_remaining) VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?)",
    creatures_data
)

genotypes_data = [(creature_id, trait_id, genotype) for ...]
cursor.executemany(
    "INSERT INTO creature_genotypes (creature_id, trait_id, genotype) VALUES (?, ?, ?)",
    genotypes_data
)
```

### 8.2 Query Optimization

**Note:** These indexes are for querying historical data from the database after creatures have been persisted. During simulation, creatures are accessed directly from the in-memory working pool.

**Creatures Table Indexes:**
- `idx_creatures_birth_generation` on (simulation_id, birth_generation) for time-series queries on historical data
- `idx_creatures_parents` on (parent1_id, parent2_id) for lineage queries on persisted creatures
- `idx_creatures_breeding_eligibility` on (simulation_id, sex, birth_generation, litters_remaining, is_alive) for analyzing breeding patterns in historical data

**Creature Genotypes Table Indexes:**
- `idx_creature_genotypes_trait` on (trait_id) for trait-based queries on historical data
- `idx_creature_genotypes_genotype` on (genotype) for genotype frequency analysis
- `idx_creature_genotypes_creature` on (creature_id) for retrieving complete genomes of persisted creatures

- Use EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN to verify index usage when querying historical data

### 8.3 Memory Management

**Working Pool Strategy:**
- All creatures that can reproduce are kept in memory as part of the working pool
- Creatures remain in memory while they are eligible for breeding (age and litters_remaining checks pass)
- This allows fast access for breeding operations without database queries

**Persistence Strategy:**
- After reproduction occurs, creatures that can no longer reproduce are identified (age limit exceeded or litters_remaining <= 0)
- Before removing creatures from working memory:
  1. Run aggregations for the current generation (genotype frequencies, phenotype distributions, etc.)
  2. Write aggregation results to the SQL database
  3. Write the creatures themselves to the SQL database (creatures table and creature_genotypes table)
- After persistence, remove creatures from working memory

**Generation Cycle:**
1. Filter working pool for eligible creatures (age limits, litters_remaining, is_alive)
2. Breeder selects pairs from eligible creatures
3. Reproduction occurs (offspring created)
4. Identify creatures that can no longer reproduce
5. Persist ineligible creatures to database
6. Remove ineligible creatures from working pool

**Benefits:**
- Fast breeding operations (no database queries for eligible creatures)
- Reduced memory footprint (only active breeding pool in memory)
- Historical data preserved in database for analysis
- Generation-level aggregations computed efficiently before persistence

## 9. Validation Rules

When creating or updating creatures:

1. **Birth Generation Consistency:**
   - Founders: birth_generation = 0, parent1_id = NULL, parent2_id = NULL
   - Offspring: birth_generation > 0, both parents must exist in the working pool (memory) and be alive

2. **Genotype Validity:**
   - Genotype string must match format defined in trait configuration
   - For sex-linked traits, genotype format must match creature's sex
   - All traits must have genotypes (no NULL genotypes)

3. **Sex-Linked Constraints:**
   - Sex-linked trait genotypes must match sex:
     - Female: Two alleles (e.g., "NN", "Nc", "cc")
     - Male: Single allele (e.g., "N", "c")

4. **Litters Remaining:**
   - Must be >= 0
   - Decrements when female reproduces
   - Starts at maximum value defined in simulation configuration
   - Only applies to females (males can have 0, but it's not used)

5. **Parent Validation:**
   - parent1_id and parent2_id must be different (no self-fertilization)
   - Parents must exist in the working pool (memory) and be alive
   - Parents' birth_generation must be < offspring's birth_generation

6. **Breeding Eligibility:**
   - **For Females:**
     - Age check: `current_generation - birth_generation <= max_female_age` 
       - `current_generation` is from memory (simulation state)
       - `birth_generation` is from memory (creature attribute in working pool)
       - `max_female_age` is from simulation config
     - Litter check: `litters_remaining > 0` (creature attribute in working pool)
     - Both checks must pass for female to be eligible
   - **For Males:**
     - Age check: `current_generation - birth_generation <= max_male_age` 
       - `current_generation` is from memory (simulation state)
       - `birth_generation` is from memory (creature attribute in working pool)
       - `max_male_age` is from simulation config
