## 5. Performance Requirements

### 5.1 Computational Performance
| Metric | Target | Stretch Goal |
|--------|--------|--------------|
| Small sim (100 creatures, 50 gen) | < 5 seconds | < 2 seconds |
| Medium sim (1,000 creatures, 100 gen) | < 60 seconds | < 30 seconds |
| Large sim (10,000 creatures, 100 gen) | < 10 minutes | < 5 minutes |
| Memory usage (1,000 creatures) | < 500 MB | < 250 MB |

### 5.2 Query Performance
| Operation | Target | Data Size |
|-----------|--------|-----------|
| Trait frequency by generation | < 100ms | 100 generations |
| Mutation history query | < 500ms | 10,000 mutations |
| Lineage trace (ancestor tree) | < 1s | 100 generations deep |
| Report generation | < 10s | Full simulation data |

### 5.3 Scalability Targets
- **Generations:** Support 1,000+ generations
- **Population Size:** Support up to 10,000 concurrent creatures
- **Traits:** Support 50+ trackable traits
- **Concurrent Simulations:** Run 10+ parallel simulations
- **Data Storage:** Efficiently store 100+ simulation histories

### 5.4 Memory Management
**Requirement:** Homed creatures must be removed from working memory to maintain performance.

**Rationale:** 
- Homed creatures (marked with `is_homed=True`) are already persisted to database
- They are removed from breeding pool and will not breed again
- Keeping them in memory (`population.creatures` list) degrades performance as population grows
- With exponential offspring growth, tens of thousands of homed creatures can accumulate

**Implementation:**
- Homed offspring are persisted to database but NOT added to `population.creatures`
- Adult creatures homed via `_spay_neuter_and_home()` are removed from memory after database update
- Removed creatures must also be removed from `age_out` lists to prevent stale references
- All removed creatures remain in database for genealogical queries and reporting

**Performance Impact:**
- Without this optimization: 100 creatures over 3 years with 5 breeders → 21,000+ creatures in memory
- With this optimization: Same simulation maintains ~300-500 creatures in memory (breeding pool only)
- Enables simulations to scale linearly with breeding pool size instead of exponentially with total births
