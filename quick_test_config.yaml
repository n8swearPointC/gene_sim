# Genotype preferences for kennel club breeders (tiered system)
# Kennels will prefer: optimal > acceptable > undesirable
# This allows kennels to breed with "acceptable" genotypes (Ll) to produce "optimal" (LL)
# while avoiding "undesirable" (ll) when possible
genotype_preferences:
  - trait_id: 1
    optimal:      # Best genotypes - actively breed toward these

      - "Ll"
    undesirable:  # Avoid these genotypes when possible

  # Example:
  # - trait_id: 0
  #   optimal: ["BB"]
  #   acceptable: ["Bb"]

# Breeder configuration
# Breeders own creatures and select mating pairs
# Ownership rules:
# - Founders assigned evenly to breeders
# - Offspring inherit from female parent's breeder
# - Random ownership transfers occur (2-3 owners per creature on average)
# - Breeders give away all offspring unless parent nearing end (then keep one replacement)
